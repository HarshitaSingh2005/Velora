    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      At <b>Velora Coffee House</b>, coffee is more than just a drink — it’s a culture, an experience, and a daily ritual that brings people closer.
      <br><br>
      Our journey began with a love for the rich aroma of freshly ground beans and the joy that a simple cup of coffee can bring. What started as a small dream has now grown into a space where warmth meets flavor, and every guest feels at home.
      <br><br>
      We carefully source our beans from trusted farmers around the world, ensuring not only premium taste but also fair trade and sustainability. Each cup you enjoy carries the dedication of farmers, the precision of roasters, and the passion of our baristas. From bold espressos to creamy lattes, every brew is crafted with heart.
      <br><br>
      But <b>Velora</b> isn’t just about coffee — it’s about people. We believe a coffee shop should be more than a place to grab your morning caffeine. It should be a community hub where ideas are shared, friendships are built, and memories are made. Whether you’re catching up with friends, working on your next big project, or simply finding a quiet corner to relax, our doors are always open to you.
      <br><br>
      Our promise is simple: to deliver comfort in every cup, joy in every visit, and a sense of belonging in every moment you spend with us. Step into Velora Coffee House, breathe in the aroma, and let us make your day a little brighter.
